# Drowsiness_Detection
Driver drowsiness is a major contributing factor in many road accidents 
worldwide. Despite the numerous campaigns and warnings about the dangers of 
drowsy driving, it remains a significant problem. This project proposes an 
innovative solution using computer vision and deep learning to detect signs of 
drowsiness and alert the driver before they potentially lose control of the vehicle.
The results of the system are primarily presented in real-time through the video 
feed. Through this, we can interpret the system's performance based on the 
correct identification of eyes and their state (open or closed), as well as the timely 
triggering of the drowsiness alert.
During the model training phase, we can also interpret the accuracy metric 
provided by Keras. A high accuracy indicates that our model is effectively learning 
to distinguish between open and closed eyes from our training data.

The dataset contains 2000 images each for closed and Open eyes in the Train folder.
